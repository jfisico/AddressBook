AddressBook
===========

Sample PHP AddressBook

Installation: Create a mySQL database and add the tables found in the installation folder. Move the files to your php server and edit the database.config.php file found under AddressBook/include.

Summary: In the time allotted (4hrs) I was able to create a functioning address book. It allows multiple users to register and login, add, edit and delete contacts from their list.

Given more time I would tighten up the error checking / field validation, probably provide client side error checking to provide a better user experience. I would have also liked to sepearte the views and style the front end.

Some additional functionality/revisions I would have liked to add in addition to using Google OAUTH and importing google contacts:

Seperate contact groups

Sorting and searching options

Pagination

Single contact view

Custom fields

Profile photos

vCard import and export
